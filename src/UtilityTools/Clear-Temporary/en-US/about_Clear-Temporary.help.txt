SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Removes temporary files from system directories, optionally runs Disk
    Cleanup, and can restart or shut down the computer.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    The `Clear-Temporary` function deletes temporary files from standard Windows
    directories, optionally executes the Windows Disk Cleanup utility
    (`cleanmgr`), and can restart or shut down the system upon completion.
    Temporary file deletion is performed safely with `ShouldProcess` support.
    You can enable detailed logging of file counts and sizes per directory and
    optionally suppress host output for quiet operation.
